This document summarizes the steps that are required to add a new artificial
tendency to MPAS-Atmosphere.

1) Define namelist options, dimensions, packages, and fields needed by 
   the artificial tendency in a new Registry_<your_art_tend>.xml file. 
   Add a #include statement for this new Registry file in 
   Registry_artificial_tendencies.xml.

2) Create a new module for the artificial tendency. By convention, the file
   and module names are expected to begin with "mpas_".

3) Add calls to the tendency's "setup", "compute", and "cleanup" routines in
   the main artificial tendency driver. Note that some artificial tendencies
   may not require all of these routines, in which case they can simply be omitted.

4) Add the object file for the new artificial tendency module to the definition of 
   ARTIFICIAL_TENDENCY_MODULES in the Makefile, and add a dependency on the new module 
   for the artificial tendency driver. If the tendency has any other dependencies
   within the artificial_tendencies/ subdirectory, specify those as well in the Makefile.
